# Predicting-the-ipl-score-machine-learning
# Introduction
#### Growth in technologies always tends us to think what will be the future and how will be the future 
#### Technologies and science will never say no to inventions and discoveries.
#### But with the fact that we cannot exactly predict the future, we could use some mathematical computations and other stuffs to help us predict what might be happening next
#### Science call it as time travel, Techies call it as Machine Learning
# Prediction Using Machine learning in python
#### It's interesting to learn from the past and reflecting it in the future, which is the exact same concept of machine earning
#### I've used the Random forest regrossor to train data containing the ball by ball scores in all the ipl matches thereby predicting the score, scored by them at the end of the match
